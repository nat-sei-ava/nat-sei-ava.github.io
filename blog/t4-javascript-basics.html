      <h3>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
      <p>Javascipt takes HTML and CSS to the next level! Javascript enables the end user to really interact with the webpage.</p>

      <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h3>
      <p>Control flow (or alternatively, flow of control) is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated.  An example of control flow in my everyday life is on Mondays my daughter goes to choir. A loop is a sequence of instructions/processes that are continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.  Dishwashing, Laundry, cooking and cleaning are the endless loops going on in my house right now.</p>

      <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.</h3>
      <p>Data in arrays is accessed by calling the data's place in the list, ie. [0], [1], [2] etc. A piece of data in objects however, needs to be found with its unique name ie. {"Nat"}.</p>

      <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
      <p>Functions are a bunch of instructions put together and given a name. It enables us to avoid having to type out the same instructions over and over.</p>

  <!-- Note: columns can be nested, but it's not recommended since Skeleton's grid has %-based gutters, meaning a nested grid results in variable with gutters (which can end up being *really* small on certain browser/device sizes) -->
