    <h3>What’s your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>

    <p>
   Over the past couple of years my thoughts on traditional education have been challenged for myself as well as my children.  The DBC/EDA experience feels like an organic process and a natural way to learn and help others.  I like the sense of community and the important that is placed on values.

      I’m here to expose my ignorance!  I feel extremely vulnerable as discussed in Shereef’s video.  I really think that I am way behind on the technical skills compared to other cohort members but I’m trying my best not to compare myself to anyone else.  I am here to learn and give as much as I can and enjoy the journey (the good and the bad).

    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>
      I honestly think I might be crazy!  Trying to study in a bootcamp style with 2 children and coming into the Christmas holidays? Who does that?  I know It’s not going to be easy (at least for me anyway).  I am well and truly outside of my comfort zone!  But all the best things in my experiences have all happened when I took some risks and stepped out of my comfort zone so I’m hoping this will be one of those experiences I can add to the memory bank too.
