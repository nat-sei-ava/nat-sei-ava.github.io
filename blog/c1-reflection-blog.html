    <h1>Reflection</h1>


    <h3>What’s your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
<p>
  Over the past couple of years my thoughts on traditional education have been challenged for myself as well as my children.  The DBC/EDA experience feels like an organic process and a natural way to learn and help others.  I like the sense of community and the important that is placed on values.
</p>
<p>
  I’m here to expose my ignorance!  I feel extremely vulnerable as discussed in Shereef’s video.  I really think that I am way behind on the technical skills compared to other cohort members but I’m trying my best not to compare myself to anyone else.  I am here to learn and give as much as I can and enjoy the journey (the good and the bad).
</p>

<h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
    <p>
      I honestly think I might be crazy!  Trying to study in a bootcamp style with 2 children and coming into the Christmas holidays? Who does that?  I know It’s not going to be easy (at least for me anyway).  I am well and truly outside of my comfort zone!  But all the best things in my experiences have all happened when I took some risks and stepped out of my comfort zone so I’m hoping this will be one of those experiences I can add to the memory bank too.
    </p>

    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>

    <p>
      I’m really looking forward to the experience and being immersed in the EDA culture for the next 18 weeks. I grew up playing a lot of sports and have always worked in team environments.  I enjoy working in teams but do also enjoy my alone time.  I am looking forward to getting to know other cohort members and working together.
    </p>

    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed?  If so, how?</h3>
<p>
  Yes!  Even though I knew EDA was not a traditional school with traditional teachers and learning techniques, after the first week I really understand that my success at EDA is in my hands (not my teachers). It’s my responsibility to do the work, learn the material and ask for help when needed (something I’m not really good at).
</p>

<h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? </h3>
<p>
  I’m excited to participate in this kind of learning environment.  I’m also super nervous at the same time.
