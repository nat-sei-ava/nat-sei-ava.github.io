    <h1>Time and Habits</h1>

    <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>

    <p>
      I'm hoping to try timeboxing in the next sprint.  I like the idea of starting with small changes in regards to habits.
    </p>

    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>

    <p>
      Everything!  From the technical work to all the concepts.  It was all overwhelming/interesting.
    </p>

    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
    <p>
      I thought it was a good idea to start while my kids are on school holidays and are at home with me.  Big mistake!  I have since found babysitters for the next week.  I like the idea of making lists and breaking things down into smaller tasks.
    </p>

    <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <p>
