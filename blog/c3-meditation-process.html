    <h1>Meditation Process</h1>

      <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
        <p>I've done yoga before so had a little experience with meditation. I discovered yoga post kids and prior to that I saw meditation as a hippy/cult like activity.  I guess with the busyness of life to me it seemed like a novelty for people with too much time on their hands.
        </p>
      <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
        <p>If I want to be happier and healthier,  I need to meditate and learn to make it apart of my daily routine.  We exercise our bodies for physical benefits like getting stronger and improving fitness however meditation is exercise for the mind.  Meditation is not magic it is practice and I can cultivate these qualities in myself.
        </P>
      <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
        <p>Posture is important.  Any position that allows me to be relaxed and alert is suitable.
        </p>
      <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
      <p>Meditation is "breathing as if your life depends on it". Happiness if the default state of mind and I'm keen to practice meditation and mindfulness to benefit my life as a whole.
