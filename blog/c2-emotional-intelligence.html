    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

      <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
        <p>
    I found it really interesting that Emotional intelligence isn't innate and can be trained.  I've always been and observer from a young age and as a mum feel like I've gained a better understanding of reading other peoples emotions.  I learned that one of the outcomes of those with high emotional intelligence is the ability to create conditions for happiness.  Who doesn't want to be happy?  Initally when deciding to enrol in Dev academy I knew my technical skills would be lacking.  After doing this assignment it has highlighted to me that even though I lack the technical skills I feel through my own personal and life experience that I have developed some of the soft skills required to be successful.  It gives me hope also that of the 6 competencies required to be successful only 2 were related to intelligence and the other 4 were related to emotional intelligence. These are skills that would benefit all areas of my life.

      <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
        <p>
      Initially I found it difficult.  It's the school holidays and my kids are loud and busy!  I've been through phases of trying to meditate and in the past have tried waking up an hour before the kids to get some quiet time before I start the day.  I've worked this into my schedule again while studying at Dev academy and so far it's going good.
