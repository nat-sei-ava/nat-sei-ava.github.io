      <h5>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5>
      <p>I popped in unexpectly to see a friend I hadn't seen in a while and tried some of the techniques suggested.  Firstly she was surprised to see me and I realised as I focused on listening that I'm not used to giving my undivided attention.  My brain is always thinking of what else needs to done.  As she talked and I listened I tried to remember to listen, loop and dip.  I personally learnt that sometimes I assume things out of habit and it's a habit I'd like to try and break.  Overall we both felt good about our conversation however I think she genuinely felt grateful that I had randomly popped over as I hadn't seen her in a while.  Will most definitely try and incorporate these technique into my everyday life. </p>

     <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>
      <p>The walking practice is a technique I will try.  Any technique that requires physical activity is beneficial.  </p>
