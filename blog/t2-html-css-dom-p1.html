    <h1>Udacity Reflection</h1>

      <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
        <p>
          The easiest analogy I can think of is a Birthday cake.  The cake is the HTML, the icing is the CSS and the extra decorations i.e candles, lollies and writing (which can be arranged as you want) are the DOM.  The HTML is the structure, the CSS is the styling and the DOM interprets this information and sometimes displays differently based on other factors.

       <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
        <p>
          All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.  Boxifying essentially means taking a design and breaking the design layout into boxes.  In web development graphic desginers may design the layout of the page and hand this over to be coded.  The first step then would be to boxify the design by either cutting the image/page up or doing a rough sketch by hand. Generally eveything we see on webpages is based on this design regardless of the whether we see the boxes.

        <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
        <p>
          The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
