    <h1>Design to Web</h1>

      <h3>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</h3>
        <p>A responsive site design adapts to whatever device being used. Essentially it is flexible and adjustable.</P>
        <p>It is extremely important as it affects the users experience.  Having consistency on various devices enhances the user experience.</p>

      <h3>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h3>
        <p>Mobile first design seeks to design first to fit the mobile screen.  It's important as using a mobile is very different to using a desktop and many consumers primarily use their phones to access the internet.  We use our thumbs on smart phones and on a desktop we would use a mouse so to be responsive it needs to be designed differently and with the end-user in mind.</p>
        <p>Mobile first design goes hand in hand with responsive design however can be more restrictive and difficult as it is the smallest screen to design for.</p>

      <h3>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons</h3>
        <p>A framework is like a template or package of standard code of HTML,CSS, and JS.  It serves as a packaged base to start your website.  I used an analogy of a cake to describe HTML,CSS and DOM.  In this case a framework would be like a pre-packaged baking mix. No need to bake it from scratch you just add a few things and you have a cake or a website.</p>
        <p>Pros of using a framework is they help you code faster and easier.  The obvious con is it may not be better or the best it can be.  Again the analogy of a cake,  Everyone knows the best cakes are never made from packet mixes nonetheless they are still good.  In my experience cakes made from scratch are the best but require more time, effort and skill.</p>

      <h3> What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h3>
        <p>A wireframe is a visual blueprint of webpage elements, features and navigation in a webpage.  Wireframes help to plan out content and the user experience first.

      <img src="wireframe-index-page-desktop.jpg" alt="index desktop"/>
      <img src="wireframe-blog-page-desktop.jpg" alt="blog desktop"/>
      <img src="wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="index mobile"/>
      <img src="/images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="index mobile" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
      <img src="images/wireframe-index-page-mobile.jpg" alt="index mobile" style="width:304px;height:228px;">


      <h3>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</h3>
      <p>I found it difficult to visualise features like fonts and design elements because a wireframe is just a layout of the site.  I think wireframing is difficult for designers as it doesn't include any design elements.
